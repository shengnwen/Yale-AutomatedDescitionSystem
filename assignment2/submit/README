# 1.For sensitivity function():
     Strategy: 
          *Equation: Score = sum of weight * npv(sub-option)*
     Since its an multi-factor problem to choose the best option, I consider all the factors with different weights. And this weight table can be modified according to real industry environment or stakeholders’ choice.
     In my hw2.py, the weight table is optionWeight = [0.08, 0.12, 0.10, 0.10, 0.09, 0.11, 0.10, 0.10, 0.12, 0.08].
     I generated 10 sub options A1 - A10 for each option A in option list, then calculate its NPV value and make it multiplied with the weight factor as an sub score  S1 - S10 for the option A. After, add all this S1 - S10 as the final score for the candidate option A. When all options score calculation is done, I will choose the option with the highest score and return this option in the final statement of the function.

# 2.For explain function():
     Strategy:
         * Use Object Oriented Programming strategy by implementing the logic inside the decision class. (Inside decision class, there are 2 functions: generatedChoice and get_explaination)
         * Find the best option for each stakeholders to their best interests (Thought this question is up to students and different option will require more coding work, i choose to implement each option for each stakeholders here. In other words, 4 stakeholders will have 4 options.)

     2.1 When the stakeholder is ‘Stockholders’: then he may interests in NPV value most, so the best option returned will be the highest NPV one;

     2.2 When the stakeholder is ‘Unions’: then he is more likely to have interests in ‘union’ members’ benefits, so the best option will be the option which employs union members with highest NPV. While there is no option with ‘union’ members, then just returned with highest NPV option and extra explanation for them why the option without union members;

     2.3 When the stakeholders is ’OH’: he want the option in ‘OH’ area, so the best option will be the option in OH with highest NPV value. However, if there is no choice in ‘OH’, we will just return with the highest NPV one and give extra explanation as why not in ‘OH’.

     2.4 When the stakeholders is ’SC’: It’s the same situation as 2.3. We will return with the highest NPV one in ‘SC’. If there is no option in “SC”, we will instead give the highest NPV one and give extra explanation.
