###### Description
This is a sample test for your hw3.
Besides the test script, there are also sample programs (hw3_sample.py, hw3_sample.R),
and sample output files (test2, test3)
You can view them as the specification to hw3.

This script will not test the bonus part!!!!

###### Data Source
You can use Yahoo Finance, Google Finance (in python) and stockPortfolio (in R).
You are not allowed to use other data sources.

You may noticed that the Yahoo Finance is not consistent with the other two.
Don't be worry about it, I will try to design a general enough grading script.
(This test script is desgined for Yahoo Finance, but should also work for the other two)


###### Specification
1. backtest (ticker = "HD", start = "2006-10-01", end = "2015-10-01", duration = 50)

return: realized gains, floating point numer, like 0.0314 (means 3.14%).
print: nothing.
file: should not open any file.

2. sectortest (startdates = ["2003-01-01"], enddates =["2009-01-01"], durations =[100], file ="test2")
startdates: a list of staring dates of the period
enddates: a list of endding dates of the period
durations: a list of durations
file: the output file

return: nothing
print: nothing

sample output file should contain something like:

best XLB 2015-01-01 2015-05-01 20 0.06
worst XLU 2015-01-01 2015-05-01 20 -0.09 
avg-period 2015-01-01 2015-05-01 -0.017
avg-duration 50 -0.020

3. realbacktest (ticker = "HD", start = "2006-10-01", end = "2015-10-01", duration = 50, commission = 2, file = "test3")
file: the output file

return: nothing
print: nothing

sample output file (without the bonus output) should contain something like:

-0.13 net return, moving average.
0.20 buy and hold return.

###### Submission
1. hw3.py or hw3.R

NOTHING ELSE!

###### How to test
1. Put your hw3.py or hw3.R in the test directory

2. After that, the test directory should look like
./hw3.py or ./hw3.R
./grade_hw3.py
./ReadMe
./hw3_sample.py
./hw3_sample.R
./test2
./test3

3. run "python grade_hw3.py"

###### Performance
The test script will also check the performance.
Make sure that your program file only contains the function definitions!

###### Dependent
This test script requires:
1. "os", "re", "subprocess", "shlex" and "time" package in Python
2. "Rscript" been installed on the computer
