###### Description
This is a sample test for your hw2.
Note that since there is no single answer to sensitivity and explain functions, this test will only check the function signature of these two functions, but I will check with your code and ReadMe file.
Also: You can earn most of the credit by doing well on stages 1 and 2.


###### Specification
0. Please look at this spreadsheet carefully to see how to calculate the npv
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZGXtz2DA9F9cLPoc2P67yk2G4duiTuoY2QiYtxOUq0U/edit#gid=0

Please don't change the function in Python:
    def __str__(self):
        return ("#<option location: " + self.location + 
            " cost: " + str(self.cost) + ">")

Please don't change the function in R:

            show = function() {
              'Method for displaying options'
              cat("This is an option\n")
              cat("Location: ", location)
              cat("\nCost: ", cost)
              cat("\nYears to complete: ", yearstocomplete)
              cat("\nLifetime: ", lifetime)
              cat("\nDiscount: ", discount)
              cat("\nUnion: ", union)
              cat("\nCost per car: ", costpercar)
              cat("\nRevenue per car: ", revenuepercar)
              cat("\nMonthly output: ", monthlyoutput, "\n")              
            },

1. npv (option)
input: an option
return: a float number.
print: nothing.
This function performs npv calculation, and return the npv.

2. decide(option_list)
input: a list of options
return: an option which is preferable
print: nothing
This function performs npv calculation for all options in the list, and return the option that have the greatest npv

3. sensitivity (option_list)
input: a list of options
return: an option which you think is preferable
print: nothing.
This function does the sensitivity analysis.

3. explain (option_list, stakeholder list)
input: the first parameter is a list of options, the second parameter is a list of stakeholder
return: an decision object
print: nothing.
This function does the explanation to stakeholders

###### Submission
1. hw2.py or hw2.R
2. ReadMe: Explains what strategy you used in sensitivity and explain() function or how do you implemented thest two functions


###### How to test
1. Put your hw2.py or hw2.R in the test directory
2. After that, the test directory should look like
./hw2.py or ./hw1.R
./grade_hw2.py
3. run
>> python grade_hw2.py


###### Dependent
This test script requires:
1. "os", "re", "subprocess", "shlex" and "time" package in Python
2. "Rscript" been installed on the computer
