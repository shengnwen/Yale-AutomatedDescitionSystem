###### Description
This is a sample test for your hw1.
Since there is no single answer to hw1, this test will only check the function signature.
Besides the test script, there are also sample programs (hw1_sample.py, hw1_sample.R).
You can view them as the specification to hw1.


###### Specification
1. sim (trials)
trials: int, specifying how many games to simulate.
return: you can decide.
print: nothing.
It will generate a file "transcript" contains the matrix of float number.
You can decide how to print the matrix.
This "transcript" file is only used in your program, I will not take a look at it.

2. hitme(playerhand, dealerfacecard)
playerhand, dealerfacecard: int.
return: boolean, true or false, specifying whether the player should ask for another card or not.
print: nothing
It should read the file "transcript" and return the result.
You should not print anything in this function.

3. play (trials)
trials: int, specifying how many games to play.
return: float, the overall winning percentage.
print: nothing.
It should call hitme and return the result
You should not print anything in this function.


###### Submission
1. hw1.py or hw1.R
2. transcript: the output of Monte Carlo siulation
3. summary: the summary output of 100,000 game playing trials 


###### How to test
1. Put your hw1.py or hw1.R in the test directory
2. After that, the test directory should look like
./hw1.py or ./hw1.R
./grade_hw1.py
3. run
>> python grade_hw1.py


###### Dependent
This test script requires:
1. "os", "re", "subprocess", "shlex" and "time" package in Python
2. "Rscript" been installed on the computer



——About the test script of hw1
I have posted the test script of hw1.

Title: test_hw1.tar.gz

You should not print anything in this function.


###### Submission
1. hw1.py or hw1.R
2. transcript: the output of Monte Carlo simulation
This file is very important.
To test your win rate, I will directly call your hitme() function (which will read this transcript file), instead of the play() function.
3. summary: the summary output of 100,000 game playing trials 


###### How to test
1. Put your hw1.py or hw1.R in the test directory
2. After that, the test directory should look like
./hw1.py or ./hw1.R
./grade_hw1.py
3. run python grade_hw1.py

###### Performance
The test script will also check the performance.
Make sure that your program file only contains the function definition.
If the program contains "sim(1000000000)", definitely, it will cause time out.

###### Dependent
This test script requires:
1. "os", "re", "subprocess", "shlex" and "time" package in Python
2. "Rscript" been installed on the computer
